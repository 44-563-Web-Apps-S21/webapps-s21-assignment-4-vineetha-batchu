<p class="speech PROTEUS">All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
Exit</p>

<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">He after honour hunts, I after love:
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</p>

<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.</p>
<h6 class="name">SPEED</h6>
<p class="speech SPEED">Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.</p>
