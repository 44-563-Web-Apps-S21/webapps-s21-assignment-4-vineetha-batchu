            <h2>Two Gentlemen of Verona</h2>
            <h3>Act 1, Scene 1: Verona. An open place.</h3>
<h6>SCENE I. Verona. An open place.</h6>
<p class="stage-direction">Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
Even as I would when I to love begin.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
If ever danger do environ thee,
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">And on a love-book pray for my success?</p>
<h6>PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">That's on some shallow story of deep love:
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">That's a deep story of a deeper love:
For he was more than over shoes in love.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">What?</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
However, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">Love is your master, for he masters you:
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS">Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">And writers say, as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
That art a votary to fond desire?
Once more adieu! my father at the road
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.</p>
<h6 class="name">PROTEUS</h6>
<p class="speech PROTEUS" >And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</p>
<h6 class="name">VALENTINE</h6>
<p class="speech VALENTINE">Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love, and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
And likewise will visit thee with mine.</p>
